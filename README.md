## Explanation of the Project
This project is a section of a planet's surface that displays the FPS and total memory being used. The planet's surface also has multiple textures, along with lighting. One instance of lighting being used is the day-night cycle. The project uses a navigable camera to explore the surface.

HLSL has been used to have orbs orbit a mountain, where the orbs glow with light.
